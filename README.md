# Web3HandsOn

This repository is my personal collection of Web3 projects as I learn Solana, Anchor, and blockchain development. Projects are uploaded progressively while I study, experiment, and practice.

## Purpose
- To save and organize all learning projects in one place
- Track progress
- Include code, notes, and ...

## Project Structure
Each folder is a separate project.(created as I complete them).

## Status
This is a work-in-progress repository. Projects are uploaded incrementally as I learn.
