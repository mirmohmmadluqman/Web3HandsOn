zToday, he gave me a new task. zzzzzYour task is to create these two functions: `withdraw` and `deposit`. Not to create, but just create them. I mean, not to give, not to tell what it does, but to create it like a boilerplate. Like we will do another thing later. To create an entry point for process instruction data. Give it instruction data. And I don't even know what to give it. And he said something like, "When you have vidra, it will be 1, and when you deposit, it will be 0." I was not getting anything.
